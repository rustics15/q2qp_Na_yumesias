        <h1>INITIATIVES</h1>
        <p>Since its launch, likharal has initiated several sessions every Saturday. Students are given 40-minute lessons for 3 subjects: Science, Math and English. They are taught by PSHS scholars who have been screened and picked based on their teaching abilities. Worksheets and resources are provided after lessons and evaluation tests are given regularly.</p>
